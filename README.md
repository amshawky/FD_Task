# FD_Task
In this repo, the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection task is solved using both classical ML techniques and Graph Convolutional Networks.
This fraud detection initiavtive started as a Kaggle's competition back in 2019 (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/overview).

To run the solution, make sure to download the full dataset files from the competition's page and run one of the two notebooks (FD_classical_ML) or (FD_GCN) for either the classical or the graph approach. Within each notebook, guiding comments are provided to give a breif description of the general steps of each approach.
